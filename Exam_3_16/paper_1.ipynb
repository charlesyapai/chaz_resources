    "```python\n",

    "**Step 2:** Calculating the Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "To calculate the PDF at x = 1 for a standard normal distribution, use the pdf function available in the norm class of scipy.stats. The pdf function requires the location (loc) and scale (scale) parameters to define the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution, respectively. For a standard normal distribution, the mean (loc) is 0, and the standard deviation (scale) is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Calculate the PDF at x = 1 for a standard normal distribution\n",
    "pdf_value = norm.pdf(x=1, loc=0, scale=1)\n",
    "print(\"PDF at x = 1:\", pdf_value)\n",
